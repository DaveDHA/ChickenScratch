# ChickenScratch

Chicken Scratch is intended to be a set of tools that help produce reasonable-looking output quickly and easily
from F# scripts and Polyglot Notebooks.  As of now, it contains a DSL based on computation expressions for 
building HTML.  There are a number of other, similar HTML DSLs, but I have a few special tricks planned.  

I also plan on adding tools for assisting working with `TabularDataResource` data sets and provided types.  

Guidance for F# Scripts can be found in the [ChickenScratch documentation](./docs/ChickenScratch.md).

Guidance for Polyglot Notebooks can be found in the ChickenScratch.Interactive documentation:

- [Html expressions in Polyglot Notebooks](./docs/Html Expressions.ipynb)
- [Working with TabularDataResource](./docs/Working with TabularDataResource.ipynb)

This is very much a work in progress, and please remember that the focus is on quick and easy output from support scripts, not 
on being the most robust HTML library available.
